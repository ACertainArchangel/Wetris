# Welcome to hardware discriptions!
This is where we can list the components and assembly instructions for the circuits needed for our modules.

## Gabe — Sound Machine
Components needed:
* Passive Piezo buzzer x3 (standard hobby specs no brand)
* Resistor x3 (very likely 100-200 ohms depending on desired volume and safety level) (no brand)
* Capacitor x3 -> Experement but 10 micro farads is likely good (no brand)
* Jumper wires to make connections (no brand)
* Possibly more and special wire depending on our casing and water proofing capabilities (tbd)
Connect pin 11 to one piezo buzzer through resistor and capacitor to ground
Connect pin 5  to one piezo buzzer through resistor and capacitor to ground
Connect pin 6  to one piezo buzzer through resistor and capacitor to ground
(place in the 3d casing TBD but can likely be close to arduino so we don't need long wires. On small breadbord perhaps.)
